The microbe-microbe interaction network shows how two closely related types of bacteria influence each other's metabolic activities. This network illustrates how these microbes interact when they grow at different rates in different individuals with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). This analysis is based on information from genome identification, similarity measures, and growth-rate data. Because the interaction between these two bacterial species can either boost or reduce the growth of one or both of them, researchers created three separate networks to visually represent these various metabolic connections.
